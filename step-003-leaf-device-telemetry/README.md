# Telemetry at the Edge
Now that the edge device has been provisioned we focus on enabling the communication of telemetry from leaf devices, which connect to the edge device directly, to the assoiated IoT Hub instance. 

In this implementation the IoT Edge device services as a field gateway, more specifically we will be implementing the gateway pattern known as a [transparent gateway](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-edge/iot-edge-as-gateway?view=iotedge-2018-06). To implement this pattern the following activities will be completed in this section:
- Configuring a leaf device simulator
- Authenticating the leaf device with the IoT Edge device
- Communicating json payload from leaf to edge and finally routing this content to the IoT Hub instance
- Persisting the time series data in the cloud 


## Learning Goals
* Leaf device authentication  
* CA certification configuration
* Routing of telemetry
* Storing time series data


## Resources
* dd

## Steps
* [Register a leaf device](#register-a-leaf-device)
* [Configure Leaf Device Simulator](#configure-leaf-device-simulator)
* [Run Leaf Device Simulator](#run-leaf-device-simulator)
* [Persisting Telemetry](#persisting-telemetry)

### Register a leaf device 
The IoT Hub instace manages both Azure IoT edge devices and leaf devices (devices that connect to an Azure IoT Edge device). To get started a leaf device needs to be registered for the simulated device
1. Navigate to the overview page for the IoT Hub in your assigned resource group. 
1. In the left menu pane select **IoT Devices** under the **Explorers** menu 
![device menu](assets/menu-iothub-device.png)
1. We will now manually create a device that represents the simulator. This approach is in contrast to the automated process used to provision the IoT Edge device. Alternatively the [Azure Device Provisioning Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-dps/about-iot-dps#when-to-use-device-provisioning-service) can be used to provision leaf devices, particularly at scale. 
1. On the **IoT Devices** page click **New**
![iot devices](assets/iot-devices.png)
2. Fill in values for the device to be created and click **Save**
    - Device ID - This will be the identifier for the leaf device
    - Authentication Type - Auto generated symmetric keys will be used
    - Parent device - Associating a leaf device with a parent edge device can be done once the leaf device is created as well but if set it enables features such as extended offline support
![create device](assets/create-new-device.png)
1. A new device is created and a symmetric key is generated that will be used by the simulator to authenticate itself with the IoT Edge device and IoT Hub


### Configure Leaf Device Simulator
The device simulator is a multi-functional command line tool that can be used to send simulated telemetry to an IoT Hub instance or an IoT Edge device. In addition the cli tool can be used to consume telemetry arriving at an IoT Hub or Event Hub. 
1. Download the execatable tool for your local environment and save in the "labs" folder. This was completed during the "Getting Started" stage
- The cli tool is a single executable. Configuration of the tool is based around named contexts which represent a collections of key value pairs. To simplify configuration contexts are associated with individual services such as IoT Hub or Event Hubs and are set on the command line. 
1. A device connection string is needed for the simulator to deliver telemetry to an IoT Edge device. From the **IoT Devices** page (as used to create the leaf device) click the **Device Id** of the simulator device
1. Click the eye icon to reveal the **Primary Connection String**. Copy this string to a text editor, it will of the form 
   ```
   HostName=<iot hub name>.azure-devices.net;DeviceId=<leaf device name>;SharedAccessKey=<key>
   ```
   ![device connection](assets/device-conn-string.png)
1. The connection string as copied refers to the IoT Hub instance directly but we require that the simulator connect to the IoT Edge device. This is done by appending a **GatewayHostName** key value pair to the connection string. The value is the fully qualified domain name of the vm hosting the iotedge runtime. 
1. Using the fully qualified domain name from the previous stage, update the connection string to be of the form:  
   ```
   HostName=<iot hub name>.azure-devices.net;DeviceId=<leaf device name>;SharedAccessKey=<key>;GatewayHostName=<vm host name>.southeastasia.cloudapp.azure.com
   ```
1. From the "labs" folder on your development machine configure a context named "simulator" replacing the connection string placeholder with the value from the previous step
   ```
   .\azmsg.exe iothub set-context simulator --device-connection-string "<connection string from previous step>"
   ```
1. Use the recently configured context
   ```
   .\azmsg.exe iothub use-context simulator
   ```

### Configure Run Leaf Device Simulator
The simulator is now configured to send telemetry to the IoT Edge device, specifically to the edgeHub moudule that is listening for connections. 
1. First attempt, run the simulator without a custom root certificate:
   ```
   .\azmsg.exe iothub simulate-device --device-type temperature_pair
   ```
   ![azmsg tls error](assets/azmsg-tls-error.png)
1. The error shown is due to the root ca authority not being trusted. The simulator has a commandline switch that can be used to provide the root certificate to be trusted. Run the command from the "labs" folder
   ```
   .\azmsg.exe iothub simulate-device --device-type temperature_pair --ca-file .\certs\pki_iot_rootca_ca.pem
   ```
1. A warning dialog will be presented when the simulator is run for the first time, click *Yes* to accept the installation of the certificate
   ![cert-install-dialog](assets/ca-cert-warn.png)
1. Once installed the simulator will display the body of the messages sent to the edge device
   ![simulator telemetry](assets/azmsg-telemetry.png)

### Viewing Telemetry
The simulator is now publishing telemetry to the IoT Edge device which is routing telemetry to IoT Hub. The routing of telemetry to IoT Hub is *not* automatic and is not a requirement to develop solutions using the Azure IoT Edge Runtime. In this section we will confirm that the route is configured, view the telemetry received by IoT Hub and examine stats.
1. Confirm that the edgeHub module has an appropriate route. The routes are configured using the module twin capability of IoT Hub
1. Navigate to the **overview** pane for the IoT Hub in your assigned resource group
1. In the left menu click **Iot Edge** under the **Automatic Device Management** section
1. On the **IoT Edge** pane click the **Device ID** for the IoT Edge device. The pane for the IoT Edge device shows the list of deployed modules
   ![edge modules](assets/edge-modules.png)
1. Click the "$edgeHub" module to open the module details pane. Click the **Module Identity Twin** link at the top of the page to view the module twin for the edgeHub
   ![edgehub module details](assets/edgehub-module-details.png)
1. Locate the properties attribute to view the configured routes
   ![edgehub routes](assets/edgehub-module-route.png)
1. If the route shown exists we can confirm the route. This route forwards all messages "/messages/*" received by the edgeHub to the "$upstream" sink which is a reserved destination that maps to the IoT Hub instance associated with the edge device
1. We'll be using Azure IoT Explorer to view the telemetry routed to IoT Hub. Alternatively you can use the Azure IoT Tools extension for VS Code
1. Launch Azure IoT Explorer and click on **IoT Hubs** in the left menu pane. On the right pane click **+ Add connection**
1. The **Add connection string** dialog appears. The connection string for the IoT Hub instance to monitor can be found by navigating to the **overview** pane for the IoT Hub instance, click on **Shared access policies** under the **Settings** left-hand menu
1. Click the **iothubowner** policy and in the fly-out pane click the eye icon and copy the "Connection string-primary key". This is the connection string that should be pasted into Azure IoT Explorer.
1. Click **Save** to setup the connection in Azure IoT Explorer
   ![iot explorer](assets/iot-explorer-connection-string.png)
1. A list of devices will be shown. Click the leaf device "devicesimulator" then **Telemetry** from the left-hand menu. Clck the **Start** button to begin observing telemetry received from the leaf device by the IoT Hub instance.

### Persisting Telemetry
There are multiple avenues for processing and storing telemetry arriving at the IoT Hub instance. In this section we will route telemetry from this IoT Hub instance to a shared Event Hub instance. The shared telemetry will then be ingested by a shared Time Series Insights instance. Telemetry will be enriched using an IoT Hub route and then transported via Event Grid
1. Enrich the telemetry from the simulator by adding a "site" property to the incoming telemetry
1. Navigate to the overview pane for your assigned IoT Hub instance
1. Click **Events** on the left-hand menu pane
1. On the **Events** pane click the **+ Event Subscription** link
1. This form gathers value that will be used to create:
   - A system topic that the IoT Hub instance will route telemetry to
   - A subscription that provides an endpoint for handlers to subscribe to the events raised when telemetry arrives
   - A filter that specifies the event types of interest
1. Fill out the form with the following values:
   - Event Subscription Name - labXXevtgridsub, replacing XX with your assigned user suffix
   - System Topic Name - labXXtelemetrytopic, replacing XX with your assigned user suffix
   - Filter to Event Types - select only **Device Telemetry**
   - Endpoint Type - Azure Function
1. For the Endpoint field, select the Azure Function as shown in the screenshot and click **Confirm Selection**
   ![select function](assets/select-azure-function.png)
1. The completed should look similar to the screenshot. Click **Create** to setup the Event Grid topic and subscription
   ![create event](assets/create-event.png)
1. The event subscription has been created.
1. Navigate to the overview pane for your assigned IoT Hub instance. Click the **Message Routing** under the **Messaging** section on the left-hand menu. 
1. Note that a route has been created to the Event Grid endpoint. 
1. Click the **Encrich messages** link to open up the message enrichment form. Add a new enrichment rule that will add a property of name "site" to all messages going to the event grid endpoint. Click **Apply** to save the enrichment.
   - Name - "site"
   - Value - "latencydevlabXX" where XX is the suffix for your user login
   - Endpoints - "eventgrid"
   ![enrichment](assets/enrich-message.png)
1. At this stage telemetry will be triggering the Azure function which will be writing transformed messages to the shared Event Hub
1. New telemetry can be viewed by navigating to the Time Series Insights instance
